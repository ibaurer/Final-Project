        <h1>Tips To Purchase Your First Home</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Buying a home can be a fundamental part of building wealth and financial success, check out these tips below
            for one important step. And please feel free to <a href="contact.html">reach out!</a></h2>
        <h3> #1- Calculate what you need to save</h3>
        A down payment can be anywhere from 0% to 20% for a first time homebuyer. A good rule of thumb is 5% of your
        planned purchase price, plus 5% for closing costs (more on that <a href="realestate.html">here</a> ). Look at a
        site like Zillow in your area to see the range of prices for a house that would work for you. Multiply this
        number by .10 and you have the number you need to save.

        <h3> #2 Make a Plan to Save</h3>
        Saving can be hard! A plan helps keep you motivated and on track. A good question to ask yourself is, what are
        you willing to give up for this house? Look at areas you can reasonably cut back each month. Take these expenses
        and divide your 10% number by the monthly amount you can save by cutting back. There you have how many months
        you need to save.


        <h3> #3 Find a good team</h3>

        You have worked hard to save and plan now you need a rockstar team!A lender and realtor will be the cornerstone
        to a successful house hunt. Ask around to see who had a good one and who didn't. Take the recommended ones and
        interview them over the phone to see if they are a good fit.
